    <h2>Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
    <h4>
      The plantar fascia is a ligament-like band running from your heel to the ball of your
      foot. This band pulls on the heel bone, raising the arch of your foot as it pushes off the ground. But if your foot moves incorrectly, the plantar fascia may become strained. The fascia may swell and its tiny fibers may begin to fray, causing plantar fasciitis.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Causes:</span> Plantar fasciitis is often caused by poor foot mechanics. Ifyour foot flattens too much, the
      fascia may overstretch and swell. If your foot flattens too little, the fascia may ache from
      being pulled too tight.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Symptoms: </span>With plantar fasciitis, the bottom of your foot may hurt when you stand, especially first thing in the morning. Pain usually occurs on the inside of the foot, near the spot where your heel and arch meet. Pain may lessen after a few steps, but it comes back after rest or with prolonged movement.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Related Problems:</span>
      A heel spur is extra bone that may grow near the spot where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel. The heel spur may form in response to the plantar fascia’s tug on the heel bone. Bursitis is the swelling of a bursa, a fluid-filled sac that reduces friction between a ligament
      and a bone. Bursitis may develop if a swollen plantar fascia presses against a plantar bursa.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Medical History and Physical Exam</span>
      Where and when does your foot hurt? Your podiatrist may first ask about your symptoms. Then he or she may feel for damaged ligaments, inflamed tendons, and displaced bones or joints. Your podiatrist may also watch you walk to see if your symptoms are caused by incorrect foot movement.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Testing</span>
      X-rays of your foot may be taken, or you may have a bone scan to confirm a suspected heel spur or a stress fracture of the heel bone .
      High Tech Ultrasound Testingof your foot may be taken to see your inflamed plantar fascia in “real time”. Its severity can be measured so that you can monitors your progress. It is also used to guide the injection into the exact area of inflammation, making healing an almost certainty.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Treatment</span>
      Reducing symptoms is your podiatrist’s first goal. Then he or she works to
      correct the cause of your problem. If your pain is due to poor foot mechanics,
      custom-made shoe inserts (orthoses) may help.

      To relieve mild symptoms try aspirin, ibuprofen, or other medications as directed. Rubbing ice on the affected area may also help.
      To reduce severe pain and swelling, your podiatrist may prescribe pills or injections. Physical therapy, such as ultrasound or stretching exercises, may also be recommended.
      To reduce symploms caused by poor foot mechanics, your foot may be taped. This supports the arch and temporarily controls movement. Night splints may also help by stretching the fascia.
      Control Movement
      If taping helps, your podiatrist may prescribe orthoses. Built from plaster casts of your feet,
      these inserts control the way your foot moves. As a result, your symptoms should go away.
      If Surgery Is Needed
      Your podiatrist may consider surgery if other types of treatment don’t control your pain. During surgery, the piantar fascia is partially cut to release tension. As you heal, fibrous tissue fills the space between the heel bone and the plantar fascia.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">What can I do to help?</span>
      You can’t stay off your feet altogether, but you can reduce overuse and the risks that come with it. Also, be sure to follow your podiatrist’s treatment plan. Take medications as directed, and wear orthoses if you have them, even while at home.

      Reduce Overuse
      Every time your foot strikes the ground, the plantar fascia is stretched. You can reduce the strain on the plantar fascia and the possibility of overuse by following these suggestions:
      -Lose any excess weight.
      -Avoid running on hard or uneven ground.
      -Wear shoes or house slippers that support your arch. Wear running shoes or sandals that have a raised heel.

  <div id="warts" class="container-answers">
    <h2>Warts</h2>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">What are Warts?</span>
        A wart is an infection caused by a virus, which can invade your skin through small cuts or breaks. Over time, the wart develops into a hard, rough growth on the surface of the skin. A wart is most commonly seen on the bottom of the foot (plantar wart), but can also appear on the top. Children, teens, and people with allergies or weakened immune systems are more vulnerable to the wart virus.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Symptoms</span>
        Warts may appear spongy, with tiny red, brown, or black spots. They can grow up to an inch or more across, occurring alone (solitary) or with smaller warts clustered nearby (mosaic). Warts are sometimes mistaken for corns or calluses. They can persist for years and recur in the same spot. If left untreated, warts can spread to other parts of the foot or even to the hands or other areas of the body.

  <div id="ingrown" class="container-answers">
    <h2>Ingrown Toenail</h2>
    <h4><span class="highlight">What is an Ingrown toenail?</span>
      An ingrown nail is the result of a nail growing into the skin that surrounds it. This often occurs at either edge of the big toe. Ingrown nails may be caused by improper trimming, inherited nail deformities, injuries, fungal infections, or pressure.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Symptoms</span>
      Ingrown nails may cause pain at the tip of the toe or ali the way to the base 0f the toe. The pain is often worse while walking. An ingrown nail may also lead to infection, inflammation, or a more
      serious condition. It it’s infected. you might see pus or redness.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Evaluation</span>
      To determine the extent of your problem, your podiatrist examines and possibly palpates (presses) the paintui area. It other problems are suspected. blood tests. cultures. or x-rays may be done as well.
    </h4>
    <h4>
      <span class="highlight">Treatment</span>
      If the nail is infected, your podiatrist may trim the corner of it to heip relieve your symptoms. He may need to remove one side of your nail back to the cuticle. The base of the nail is then treated with a chemical to keep the ingrown part from growing back. Severe infections or ingrown nails may require antibiotics and permanent removal of a portion of the nail. To prevent pain, a local anesthetic may be used in these procedures. This treatment is usually done at your podiatrists office. Dr. Cettie has perfected this treatment for over 27 years.

      Depending on the severity of the infection or how ingrown the nail is, Dr. Cettie determines if Dr. Cettie determines if only the border or the total nail will need to be removed. Dr. Cettie permanently removes the ingrown nail because if the nail is allowed to grown back it will be ingrown again.

      -This procedure takes only 5-10 minutes
      -Patients can be back on their feet the same day as the procedure
      -Cosmetically- If it is a partial removal the skin will grow back to the new border. If a total removal is required the skin once healed will be smooth and can be painted over.
