      <p>Board Certified Podiatrist and has been practicing for over 20 years in Wichita Falls, Texas. I specialize in helping peoples feet feel better. I treat <span class="keywords">ingrown nails, heel pain, hammertoes, corns, plantar warts, and many more foot related issues</span>. I take pride in being the best at what I do without compromising. That means I listen carefully to my patients complaints and take the time to fully understand what is needed to diagnose and gently heal their problem. I have the surgical confidence and experience to make sure that the best possible outcomes will occur. I custom make my own orthotics as I have been specially certified and trained in this exclusive field by the Podiatrist for our Olympic athletes. High tech imaging via diagnostic ultrasound is also used to measure the severity of certain foot and ankle conditions. My electronic medical software can be used to share your information quickly and securely with other doctors, labs, and hospitals to ensure that you receive the best treatment possible.</p>

    <div id="podiatry-info" >
      <p class="foot-info">Podiatric medicine focuses on diagnosing, treating, and preventing <span class="keywords">foot and ankle problems, such as plantar fasciitis</span>. Your podiatric physician (podiatrist) is highly trained through years of study and clinical practice, including a bachelorâ€™s degree program and four
        years of podiatric medical school. In addition, podiatrists often have one
        or more years of residency training to study foot care and surgery in greater
        depth. Once in practice, podiatrists continue to stay informed about the latest research and developments in the field. In treating your feet, your podiatrist may also work with your other health care providers to give you appropriate and comprehensive care .
