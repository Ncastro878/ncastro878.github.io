        Most Podiatrists and Orthopedic Surgeons have to use outside labs to fabricate orthotics, but not Dr. Cettie. <span class="keywords">Dr. Cettie is one of only five leading experts in the world</span> who is specially trained in biomechanics to fabricate custom made orthotics and Richie Braces. Utilizing state of  the art lab facilities and 27 years of experience, Dr. Cettie is able to create orthotics that are made to specifically treat and prevent whatever issue a patient is having with their feet and ankles. They are guaranteed for life and any adjustments are included at no additional charge to the patient.

We will check with your insurance on these benefits, however, it is not a guarantee of payment from your insurance.

      You will most commonly hear them referred to as orthotics, but they have been referred to as foot appliances, inserts, plates, and even arch supports. The thing they are NOT are arch supports.
    </h3>
    <p id="orthotics-text-2">
      True biomechanical orthotics devices do not work on the principal of “supporting” the arch. The impressions or casts which Dr. Cettie will make for your feet are taken in a specific position which captures the angular relationships between the various segments of each foot. Thus, when models of your feet are constructed at the laboratory, we are able to capture your best functioning positions in those models. Then, the bodies of your orthotics devices are contoured and angled over those models. Finally, orthotics devices additional components called post controls may be added to the front, rear, or both ends of the orthotics devices and reground to specific angles to fit your particular foot type. Consequently, instead of supporting arches, biomechanical devices create more normal functioning of the feet and legs by maintaining the anatomical angular relationships between the segments of each foot and leg, while the control posts cause the orthotics devices to move or subtly rock into specific positions at specific phases in the gait or walking cycle. This action controls abnonnal motion without restricting normal motion and eliminates the jarring effect so commonly associated with conventional arch supports. The end result is a decrease or elimination of foot symptoms, corns, and calluses, and very often even leg and back fatigue resulting from using the wrong muscles at the wrong time.
